Despite some hiccups, the Adapty team was always there to help us during the migration and afterward, and their support is top-notch. I recommend Adapty as a reliable partner.",

We've tested them all: products, title text, CTA buttons, images, videos etc. With Adapty's A/B testing, we managed to double our monthly revenue. I wasn't sure if one instrument could make such an impact, but I witnessed it myself.",
